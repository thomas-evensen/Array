	*****
	finally a decent dhtmldemo. 
	this is the real thing.. 1375 layers animated at once..
	things that really should't be possible
	
		
	+WE LOVE HYPERISLAND+
		
	
	will only run in ie6+ and hopefully you also got a 800mhz++
	also need flashplayer5..for the music... and directx8 should also be installed
	don't ask me why we need dx8 in a dhtml demo...it just works better :)
